# android2pc-bluetooth-server

Client is located under https://github.com/kursat/android2pc-bluetooth-client

Developed using **javax.swing**.

Allows multiple client to connect, and receive/broadcast message to all clients over bluetooth.


I had to translate some comments, variables, ids, tags etc. in **Turkish**. If anyone wants to use this I can translate it back to **English**.

***If so let me know***.
